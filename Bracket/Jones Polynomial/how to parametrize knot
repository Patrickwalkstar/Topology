This is a tutorial on how to determine a polynomial precursor parametrization for a knot diagram:
First:
    assign unique identities to each intersection
Second:
    determine whether each intersection has a positive orientation or negative orientation
Third:
    Determine a direction to follow along the length of the knot.
fourth:
    for each complete strand you come to along the length of the knot perform the following:
        record the intersection the strand starts at. if it is a positive orientation record a 1 with the identity of the intersection.
        if it is a negative orientaiton, record a -1.
            record the intersection and the directionality number (+1 or -1 as stated previously) as a parametrization
        record each intersection the strand passes through (overcrossing). the strand has a directionality of 0 for these intersecions
            record the intersections and their directionality number (in this case 0) as pairs
        record the intersection the strand terminates at. if it is a positive orientation record a -1 for the directionality number, and
        if it is a negative orientation, record a 1.
            record the intersection and the directionality number as a pair
        the notation for each strand is the collection of pairs generated in this manner with the intersections in order along
        length of strand
fifth:
    the notation for the knot diagram is the list of strands

Overall, the polynomial precursor parametrization for a knot diagram will look like a list of strands which are lists 
of pairs of an intersection and a directionality number
