## 2D-Manifold Glueing

This program, with an input polygon schema, can calculate the three qualities that form a complete invariant of 2-dimensional manifolds: the Euler characteristic, the orientability and, the genus of the resulting surface. The homogeneity class (the homogenous space formed)
of the presented polygon schema is calculated with the three qualities above.

## Bracket/Jones Polynomial

Using the "Walker parameterization" as the input of a knot (described in the attached paper), this program calculates the bracket polynomial and Jones polynomial of that knot.
